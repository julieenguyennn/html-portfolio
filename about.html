    <h3> My Story </h3>
    <p> My first design task was when I joined a university club. At that time, with very little knowledge of Photoshop, I was able to make my baby steps into the industry. Along the way, I realized that designing products that drive social impact was what I'd always been looking for. I began to pick up different designing tools, find inspiration, and practice through every single personal/ organizational project. </p>
    <br/>
    <p> Now, I am currently an undergrad studying UX Design and aim at bringing the best solutions that both tailor the needs and improve digital well-being. </p>
